What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create a container and tell Git to track all the changes to the files
that are added to the repository.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the limbo between working directory and repository.
It allows you some finer granularity in what to commit to a repository.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

You could use git diff --staged to check the differences between the
staged file and the latest commit.
Furthermore, if you are dealing with a multi-file project, you could
only stage the relevant file which would preclude any changes in
other files to be commited.



What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

If you are considering two possible ways to develop your projects further.
Maybe you think one is too risky by far as regarding the likelihood with
which you are going to be satisfied with the end result. You could just
branch off the master path to toy with the idea for a while and see
where your efforts take you.
