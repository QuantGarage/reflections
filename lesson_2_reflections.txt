What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create a container and tell Git to track all the changes to the files
that are added to the repository.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the limbo between working directory and repository.
It allows you some granularity in what to commit to a repository.
